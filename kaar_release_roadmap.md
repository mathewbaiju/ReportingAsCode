## Release Summary

### Release 1 (v42) - Foundation Decisions
**Focus: Strategic Decisions & Planning**
- 3 key decision points established
- Foundation for cluster segmentation, routing, and ADF interface

### Release 2 (v43) - Core Infrastructure  
**Focus: Primary Infrastructure Deployment**
- 8 deliverables including core US clusters
- ADF translation capabilities
- Multi-stack design readiness
- Application events infrastructure

### Release 3 (v44) - Regional Expansion
**Focus: Regional Scale-out & Configuration Management**
- 8 deliverables expanding to international regions
- Advanced configuration management (region agnostic, canary)
- Promotion testing and harness integration
- Decision on node group strategy

### Release 4 (v45) - Production Readiness
**Focus: Production Features & Testing**
- 15 deliverables (largest release)
- Complete production cluster deployment
- Comprehensive testing framework
- Advanced KaaR features (IAM, DB migration, dependencies)
- Security and automation features

### Release 5 (v46) - Migration & Advanced Support
**Focus: Migration Completion & Platform Support**
- 6 deliverables completing the roadmap
- UK+4 application migration
- ARM and Windows container support
- Advanced networking and HA configuration

## Release Statistics

| Release | Total Items | Focus Area | Risk Level |
|---------|:-----------:|------------|:----------:|
| **v42** | 3 | Foundation Decisions | Low |
| **v43** | 8 | Core Infrastructure | Medium |
| **v44** | 8 | Regional Expansion | Medium |
| **v45** | 15 | Production Features | High |
| **v46** | 6 | Migration & Support | Medium |

**Total: 40 deliverables across 5 releases**

## Key Observations

### Release Distribution Strategy
- **Front-loaded decisions**: Early releases focus on critical architectural decisions
- **Gradual scale-up**: Infrastructure deployment spreads across multiple releases
- **Feature convergence**: v45 has the highest concentration of features (potential bottleneck)
- **Clean migration**: Final release dedicated to migration and advanced platform support

### Dependencies & Risk Factors
- **v43 → v44**: Regional expansion depends on core infrastructure completion
- **v44 → v45**: Production features require regional infrastructure foundation
- **v45 → v46**: Migration cannot proceed without production readiness
- **Critical Path**: v45 represents the highest delivery risk due to volume (15 items)

### Team Workload Distribution
- **Infrastructure Teams**: Heavy involvement in early releases (v42-v44)
- **Pipeline Teams**: Primary focus in mid-to-late releases (v43-v45)
- **Platform Support**: Concentrated in final releases (v45-v46)
